[h1]Adds a foreboding storyteller that adds omens to RimWorld stories.[/h1]

In this mod, Lovecraft will be added to your list of storytellers. In Lovecraft&apos;s tales, protagonists often face their own mortality and insignificance in the universe. Threats to your colony and its sanity will be constant. Can your colony survive a cosmic horror tale?

[b]A Dog Said Patch : Now Included with this mod. No seperate download required.[/b]

* Black cats can be found as part of the omens, and they are randomly named after famous Weird Fiction authors should they take a liking to your colony.
