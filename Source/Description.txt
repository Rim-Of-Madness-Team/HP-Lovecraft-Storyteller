  Adds a foreboding storyteller that adds tension to RimWorld stories.

  In this mod, Lovecraft will be added to your list of storytellers. In Lovecraft's tales, protagonists often face their own mortality and insignificance in the universe. Threats to your colony and its sanity will be constant. Can your colony survive a cosmic horror tale?

  ------------
  Rewrites the threat cycle of RimWorld to include "omens."
  Omens are events that precede larger and more horrible events.
  Currently, the mod contains 13 simple omen events, 2 bigger omen events, and 1 more planned.

  * An example omen, a blood moon, will cause unease among all that see it.

  * Black cats can be found as part of the omens, and they are randomly named after famous Weird Fiction authors should they take a liking to your colony.
